We propose a Global Store abstraction (GS) for building high-performance reliable collaborative applications sharing a large amount of objects. The global store or the fault-tolerant store (FTS) can also be used to implement a fault tolerant mobile agent platform. A store is composed of a set of objects. Each application has a reference to the store. The application accesses objects with a transactional interface. Users connect and disconnect to the store dynamically. GS allows local modifications to be seen instantaneously without waiting for a slow network. Applications can also update objects without worring about concurrency control and store failure. The GS handles site crashes which are invisible to the user i.e. crashes are only visible as possible delays of objects updates. If there are n sites, n-1 crash sites are tolerated. The global coherence of the store is maintained in case of site crashes.As long as at least one site runs, the store survive. No persistence is used; the redundancy of multiple localStore is enough to provide fault tolerance. We use a client-server architecture, the server is a lightwight server whose main purpose is to manage locks on objects in the store. Server can migrate to any client's site. A server crash is tolerated; in this case the a live clients runing a consensus algorithem to select a new leader that creates a new server. All this is invisible to the user, who sees failures as temporary slowdown in the time it takes to reply a commit/abort message. The global coherence is maintained at all times </P><DIV align="center"><IMG alt="" src="fts.gif"></DIV><P> </P><P> GS provides several types of transparencies: </P><UL><LI><P><EM>Failure transparency</EM>: which hides failures from an object to enable fault tolerance. </P></LI><LI><P><EM>Slow network transparency</EM>: which hides delays of network operations to enable instantaneous updates of objects. </P></LI><LI><P><EM>Transaction transparency</EM>: which hides coordination of activities amongst a configuration of objects to achieve consistency. </P></LI><LI><P><EM>Migration transparency</EM>: which hides from the object the system's ability to change the location of that object, e.g. for load balancing, or reducing latency. </P></LI></UL><P> </P><P>The current implementation of the <CODE>GlobalStore</CODE> Module have two constraints: </P><UL><LI><P>Store objects must have no references to resources.
