<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>
This package provides a very simple but high-level GUI that can accept
input as strings or Oz terms and pass it to a user-defined procedure
for further processing. Inputs can be stored in a list and saved into
and loaded from files. In addition, the programmer can specify menus
that allow the user to select options, which are also passed to the
main procedure.</p>

<p>
The main design principle of this package was to keep the interface
specification as high-level as possible; the most low-level concept
that the programmer has to deal with is a menu. This makes it possible
to attach a newly built procedure to a graphical interface very
easily, without having to think about any details of graphical
interfaces. The flexibility of the interface is quite limited (hence
the name). If it is not powerful enough for your needs, I recommend
you use one of the many more powerful GUI libraries available for
Mozart, such as <a
href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/mogul/info/grolaux/qtk.html">QTk</a>.
At the moment, SimpleGUI builds upon QTk.</p>

SimpleGUI was originally developed in the context of applications from
computational linguistics, which shows in some choices of words. I
wrote it because I would usually build a procedure that did something
interesting, and got tired of having to recompile my test program
every time I wanted to change the inputs. The interface was heavily
inspired by, but is not technically related to, the GUI in the <a
href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/cl/projects/chorus.html">CHORUS</a>
demo system, as well as Denys Duchier's GUI for his <a
      href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/mogul/info/duchier/coli/dg.html">dependency parser</a>.<p>


<H2>Installation</H2>
<p>
SimpleGUI is distributed as an <a
	href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/mogul/info/duchier/ozmake.html">ozmake</a>
package. After the download, you can compile and install it with the
      command
<CODE CLASS="DISPLAY">ozmake --install --package=koller-simplegui.pkg</code>


<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
The windows that SimpleGUI can draw look as follows:</p>

<p align=center>
<img src="simplegui.gif" alt="[SimpleGUI screenshot]">
<br>
Fig. 1: Screenshot of a SimpleGUI application.
</p>

The basic idea of the system is that as soon as the user clicks the
"Go!" button, a user-defined procedure (which we call the <i>Go!
Action</i>) is called. This procedure is passed the current values of
the text boxes just above the button. Furthermore, it is possible to
define options for the procedure, which are represented in the
menus. These options are also passed to the Go! action when the button
is pressed.<p>

The listbox above the textboxes contains values for the textboxes
which were recorded earlier. The "Examples" menu has functions for
managing the listbox: The current values can be added to the list, and
the currently selected row can be deleted from it. Finally, the "File"
menu has functions to save and load the contents of the listbox.<p>


<h2>Example</h2>

For an example program, see the file <a href="sgtest.oz">sgtest.oz</a>
that accompanies this package and is automatically compiled into
<code>sgtest.exe</code> when you run <code>ozmake</code>.


<H2>Usage</H2>
<p>
The SimpleGUI window is created as follows:
</p>
<code class="display">
functor

import
  SimpleGUI at 'x-ozlib://koller/simplegui/simplegui.ozf'

define
  {SimpleGUI.create Values Go Menu GlobalOptions}

end
</code>

<p>
Below, we will discuss the values that can be passed in each argument
to the <tt>Create</tt> procedure.
</p>



<h3>Values</h3>

The <code>Values</code> argument declares the values which can be entered
via the textboxes. It is a list of value declarations of the following
form:

<code class="display">
value(id:    Atom
      label: VirtualString
      type:  {ozval, string}           % default: string
      flags: list(Flag))               % default: nil
</code>
      
In the <code>id</code> field, you specify a unique id for this entry. It
will later be used as a feature in the record that is passed to the
Go! action.<p>

In the <code>label</code> field, you specify the label that is prepended to
the textbox in the GUI. In the screenshot above, we have used the
<code>text</code>s <code>'Label'</code>, <code>'Semantics'</code>, and <code>'Main
Event'</code>.<p>

In the <code>type</code> field, you specify in what form SimpleGUI should
pass the value of the textbox to your Go! procedure. If the value is
<code>string</code> (the default), the current contents are passed
verbatim as a string. If the value is <code>ozval</code>, it is first run
through the Oz compiler to produce an Oz value. If the contents of the
textbox do not specify a valid Oz value, you will get a Compiler
exception.<p>

In the <code>flags</code> field, you can specify a list of flags; the
default is the empty list (no flags). At the moment, the following
flags are interpreted:<p>
<dl>
<dt><code>editor</code> 
<dd> If an entry has this option, a little button labeled "E" appears
to the right of the textbox. If you have set the environment variable
<code>EDITOR</code>, a click on this button will open an editor with
the current values of the textbox. If you edit the value in the
editor, save, and quit the editor, the new value will be copied into
the textbox. (This is useful e.g. if you want to use Emacs'
bracket-matching functionality.) If the <code>EDITOR</code> variable
is not set, the "E" button will be disabled.
</dl>

	
<h3>Go!</h3>

As the second argument to <code>Create</code>, you pass a procedure
that takes two arguments, e.g.

<code class="display">
    proc {$ Values Options}
       {Inspector.inspect go(val:Values opt:Options)}
    end
</code>

This procedure is called whenever you click the "Go!" button in the
SimpleGUI window. In the first argument, the procedure is passed a
record containing the current values of the textboxes. For each of
them, the record has a feature with the <code>id</code> of the value,
and the value at this feature is the current value of the textbox,
interpreted according to the entry's <code>type</code>.<p>

In the second argument, the procedure is passed a record describing
the current state of the options in the menus. For each (Boolean or
file choice) option menu entry, the record has a feature with the
option's <code>id</code>, and the value at this feature is the current
value of the option (i.e. either a Boolean or a string).<p>


<h3>Menu</h3>

The SimpleGUI window always has two menus labeled "File" and
"Examples". The first menu contains entries for loading and saving the
examples list as an Oz pickle, and for quitting the program. The
second menu contains functions for adding and deleting entries from
the examples list.<p>

However, you can add more menus if you like. Menu entries can either
be bound to a procedure, which is called when you select the menu
entry, or they can be linked to an option, whose value is
automatically passed to the Go! action and to Menu actions.<p>

You do this by passing as the third argument of <code>Create</code> a
(potentially empty) list of menu definitions as follows:

<code class="display">
menu(label:   VirtualString
     entries: list(MenuEntry))
</code>

A menu entry is a term of one of three types: a (Boolean) option, a
file choice option, or an action. Each menu entry must specify a
<code>label</code>, which is the label shown in the menu on the
screen. It may also specify an <code>accelerator</code>, a keystroke
which can be used to access the menu entry more quickly (see the <a
href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/mogul/doc/grolaux/qtk/node41.html">QTk
documentation</a> for a definition of valid accelerator descriptions).
Finally, the option entries all have <code>id</code> features, which
must be unique and are used to identify the option in the options
record passed to actions.

<h4>Boolean Options</h4>
<code class="display">
option(id:          Atom
       default:     Boolean
       label:       VirtualString
       accelerator: AcceleratorDefinition)
</code>

Boolean options allow the user a Boolean choice between two options
(on and off). They are realized as menu entries with little
checkboxes.


<h4>File Choice Options</h4>
<code class="display">
filechoice(id:          Atom
           label:       VirtualString
           accelerator: AcceleratorDefinition
           default:     VirtualString)
</code>

File choice options allow the user to select a file, using the Tcl/Tk
file choice dialogue. The name of this file is then passed to actions
in the feature for this option.


<h4>Actions</h4>
<code class="display">
action(label:       VirtualString
       accelerator: AcceleratorDefinition
       action:      Proc/2)
</code>

When the user selects this menu entry, the procedure specified in the
<code>action</code> feature is called. The procedure is passed the
current values of the textboxes and of the options in two records, in
the same way as the Go! action. Action menu entries don't need an
<code>id</code> feature because they don't define options which could
be passed to other actions.


<h3>Global Options</h3>

In the fourth and final argument to the <code>Create</code> function,
you can pass a record that sets some global options which e.g. control
the display of the SimpleGUI window. If you do not want to set any
options, just pass an atom or <code>unit</code>. At the moment,
SimpleGUI handles the following features in this argument:<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>title</code> 
<dd> (default: <code>'SimpleGUI Window'</code>)
The window title.<p>

<dt><code>width</code>
<dd> (default: 40)
The width of the window, in characters.<p>

<dt><code>golabel</code>
<dd> (default: <code>'Go!'</code>)
The label of the Go! button.<p>

<dt><code>autoload</code>
<dd> (default: not defined)
If you pass a virtual string under this feature, SimpleGUI will
attempt to load the file specified by the virtual string, as if
you had selected it from the File/Load menu.
</dl>



<h2>Exceptions</h2>

The package throws the following exceptions:<p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>saveload(error:cantOpen path:Path filename:Filename)</code>
<dd>The file you selected in a File/Load dialogue can't be opened
(for whatever reasons).<p>

<dt><code>saveload(error:cantSaveIn pathname:Pathname path:Path filename:Filename)</code>
<dd>The file you selected in a File/Save dialogue can't be written into
(for whatever reasons).<p>

<dt><code>textboxes(error:unknownType fct:getValues type:Type)</code>
<dd>You specified an invalid type <code>Type</code> for one of the values you
	passed to <code>Create</code>.<p>
</dl>
     




<h2>Portability</h2>

SimpleGUI was developed under Linux. I haven't tested it on other
platforms, but I believe it should run wherever Mozart and ozmake
run. If you can confirm or deny this, please <a
href="mailto:koller@coli.uni-sb.de">let me know</a>.



<h2>Bugs</h2>

As this is the first public version of SimpleGUI, I'm sure it contains
too many bugs to mention. If you find one, I'd appreciate if you could
<a href="mailto:koller@coli.uni-sb.de">let me know</a> so I can fix
it.<p>

What is <i>not</i> a bug is that the interface is simple and not very
flexible; I deliberately wanted to keep the complexity down. I'd love
to hear your suggestions on how to improve the package, but please
keep this proviso in mind.<p>

One bug I'm aware of is that after an update of Mozart, you will not
be able to read your old saved example lists any more. This is because
I have implemented saving and loading with Oz pickles for convenience,
and pickles aren't binary compatible between different versions of
Mozart. I want to correct this in the next release.<p>
