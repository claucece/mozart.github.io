    <h1>ConCat: A Constraint Workbench for Categorial Grammar</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~kuhlmann/projects/concat/">ConCat</a> is
      planned as a workbench for the application of constraint programming
      techniques to the processing of categorial grammars.  In the current
      release, it includes components for a parser for resource-sensitive
      categorial grammar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Detailed information about the theoretical foundation that ConCat is built
      on can be found in Marco Kuhlmann's MSc thesis, <a
      href="kuhlmann2002towards.pdf">Towards a Constraint Parser for Categorial
      Grammar</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To explore the system, it is recommended that you study the source code
      (which is fairly well commented) and run the file <tt>TEST.oz</tt> in the
      <tt>examples</tt> subdirectory of the distribution.  This will give you an
      Explorer window, which has been amended by various information actions.
