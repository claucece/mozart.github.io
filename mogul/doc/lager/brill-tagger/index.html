<!-- PURPOSE -->
<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>This is an implementation in pure Oz of a Brill-style rule-based tagger (Brill 
  1995). The tagger is an abstract class (in the sense that it does not define 
  all the methods that it calls) and you will need to subclass it in order to 
  do something useful. In particular, a derived class is expected to contain (or 
  import) the rules by means of which the tagger will be operating and thus it 
  encapsulates everything which is specific to a particular language and application. 
  The package includes two examples which show how to build a part-of-speech tagger 
  for English, as well as a combined part-of-speech tagger and noun-phrase chunker, 
  also for English. The accuracy of the part-of-speech tagger should be around 
  95-97% (i.e. 95-97% of the word tokens in arbitrary English text receive the 
  correct tag). An overview of the <a href="penn.html">tagset</a> is available. 
  The accuracy of the chunker is probably around 91-92 percent. Injected with 
  more rules it can be expected to land just above 93%. At least this is the result 
  that Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) claim for this kind of chunker. 
<P>This package does <i>not</i> (yet) include a transformation-based learner. 
  To train your own taggers, see for example my <a href="http://www.ling.gu.se/%7Elager/mutbl.html">&micro;-TBL 
  system</a> or the <a href="http://nlp.cs.jhu.edu/%7Erflorian/fntbl/index.html">fnTBL 
  toolkit</a>. These systems generate rules with a different syntax, but the conversions 
  are straightforward and can be done automatically. 
<P>A short description of how a Brill tagger/chunker works follows. A reader only 
  interested in <i>using</i> a part-of-speech tagger or noun-phrase parser could 
  probably skip this part. On the other hand, a reader wanting to know even more 
  should read (Brill 1995) and (Ramshaw and Marcus 1995). A reader wanting to 
  really explore what this paradigm has to offer should consult my <a href="http://www.ling.gu.se/%7Elager/Mutbl/bibliography.html">Transformation-Based 
  Learning bibliography</a>. It turns out that wonderful things can be achieved: 
  not only part-of-speech tagging and chunking, but also word sense disambiguation, 
  dialogue act tagging, morpheme-phoneme conversion, etc. 
<h3>How the Part-of-Speech Tagger Works</h3>
<P>In the first step, a lexical lookup module assigns exactly one tag to each 
  occurrence of a word (usually the most frequent tag for that wordform), disregarding 
  context. Here is the single rule responsible for this:
<blockquote> 
  <pre><code>init(pos wd @lex.lookup)</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The lexicon has been generated from tagged corpora and contains more than 93,000 
  entries. </p>
<P>In the seconds step, words not in the lexicon are handled separately, by the 
  guesser. The guesser starts by assigning tag NNP to unknown capitialized words, 
  and NN to others. This is the relevant rule: 
<blockquote>
  <pre><code>replace(pos 'unknown' 'NNP' 'NN') # [isCap#[0]]</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<P>Then replacement rules are applied that may change these tags on the basis 
  of a simple suffix analysis. Here is a guessing rule:
<blockquote>
  <pre><code>replace(pos 'NN' 'JJ') # [suffix#less#[0]] </code> </pre>
</blockquote>
<P>The rule means "replace tag NN with JJ if the word in question ends in "less"". 
<P>In the fourth step, the rule application module proceeds to replace some of 
  the tags with other tags, on the basis of what appears in the local context. 
  Here is a typical context rule: 
<blockquote> 
  <pre><code>replace(pos 'VB' 'NN') # [canHave#'NN'#[0] pos#'DT'#[~1]] </code> </pre>
</blockquote>
<P>The rule means "replace tag VB with NN if the the word in question can have 
  tag NN (according to the lexicon) and if the previous word is tagged DT". 
<P>The present system uses around 50 guessing rules and nearly 300 context rules. 
  Both kinds of rules have been induced from tagged corpora by means of Transformation-Based 
  Learning (TBL). 
<h3>How the Noun-Phrase Chunker Works</h3>
<P>A noun-phrase chunker tries to mark up all the (basic) noun phrases in a text. 
  The idea behind this particular chunker - due to Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) - 
  is to view chunking as a tagging problem, and to encode the chunk structure 
  as tags attached to each word. Three tags - I, O and B - are used to indicate 
  if a word occurrence is inside an NP, outside an NP, or on the border between 
  two NPs, respectively. 
<P>Since the rules for noun-phrase chunking are meant to apply to part-of-speech 
  tagged text, the chunker also includes a Brill part-of-speech tagger. Thus, 
  the noun-phrase chunker contains all the rules that the tagger contains plus 
  a number of rules for chunking. 
<P>The chunking steps do not introduce any new kinds of rules. The first step 
  creates a new field for each word and initializes it with a default NP tag (i.e. 
  I, O, or B) based on the part-of-speech that it has (according to the part-of-speech 
  tagging phase). Thus: 
<blockquote> 
  <pre><code>init(np pos @pos2np_mapping.lookup) </code> </pre>
</blockquote>
<P>A sequence of chunking rules are then applied, that will replace NP tags with 
  other NP tags, based on what the local context looks like. Here is a typical 
  chunking rule: 
<blockquote> 
  <pre><code>replace(np 'I' 'O' ) # [np#'O'#[1] pos#'JJ'#[0]] </code> </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The rule means "replace tag I with tag O if the next word is tagged O and the 
  part of speech of the word in question is JJ". In the present system there are 
  100 rules of this kinds. 
<H2>Installation</H2>
<P>Download the package, and invoke ozmake in a shell as follows: 
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>ozmake --install --package=lager-brill-tagger.pkg</code></p>
</blockquote>
<P>By default, all files of the package are installed in the user's <code>~/.oz</code> 
  directory tree. In particular, all modules are installed in the user's private 
  cache.

<H2>Example Applications</H2>
<P>The distribution includes two example applications: a part-of-speech tagger 
  and a noun-phrase chunker. These applications use the <span class="MODULE">EnglishTagger</span> 
  module and <span class="MODULE">EnglishChunker </span>module, respectively. 
  They also use the modules <a href="http://www.ling.gu.se/%7Elager/mogul/sentence-splitter/index.html">SentenceSplitter</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.ling.gu.se/%7Elager/mogul/Tokenizer/index.html">EnglishTokenizer</a>, which will have 
  to be installed in the user's cache. 
<P>Given the file <a href="test.txt"><tt>test.txt</tt></a> the invocation 
<blockquote>
  <pre><code>tag --in=test.txt --out=test.tagged.txt --statistics</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<P>will produce the file <a href="test.tagged.txt"><tt>test.tagged.txt</tt></a>. 
  It will also print the following statistics: 
<blockquote>
  <p><code>2321 words (90 sentences) tagged in 3.02 seconds (769 W/s).<br>
    Reading: 0.0 s. <br>
    Splitting: 0.06 s. <br>
    Tokenizing: 0.16 s. <br>
    Tagging: 2.8 s.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<P>(This example, by the way, was run on my old portable 166Mhz PC. On a more 
  decent computer it would be a lot faster.)
<P>The invocation 
<blockquote> 
  <pre><code>chunk --in=test.txt --out=test.chunked.txt</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>will produce the file <a href="test.chunked.txt"><tt>test.chunked.txt</tt></a>.
