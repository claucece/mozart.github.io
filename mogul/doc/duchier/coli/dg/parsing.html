<h1>3 Parsing</h1>

<p>
The parser is implemented using a reduction of the formulation of TDG
into a constraint problem stated in terms of finite sets.  The
reduction is more thoroughly described in
<a href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/Papers/abstracts/duchier-mol6.html">
(Duchier 99)</a>
<a href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/Papers/abstracts/duchier-jlac2000.html">
(Duchier 00)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/Papers/abstracts/duchier-fgmol2001.html">
(Duchier 01)</a>.  Parsing amounts to searching for solutions of the
CSP which describes the valid TDG analyses for a given input. Thereby,
we apply alternating propagation and distribution steps (note:
distribution can be optionally turned off). With the help of the
<em>selection constraint</em>, we achieve very strong propagation. In
fact, in many cases no search at all is necessary, in spite of
substantial lexical and structural ambiguity.

<h2><a name="generate">3.1 Generate mode</a></h2>

<p>
It is possible to switch the parser into generate mode. In generate
mode, the parser regards the list of words comprising the string to
parse not as a list but a bag of words. Hence, the parser finds all
TDG analyses which are licensed for this bag of words. Generate mode
can be used to debug a grammar: it can help finding undesired TDG
analyses. It is also employed by the graphical user interface (see <a
href="gui.html">chapter 5</a>) to generate the set of linearizations
licensed for a bag of words.

<p>
The TDG parser allows to individually toggle each of the ID, LP and
TH principles on and off which also facilitates grammar debugging.
