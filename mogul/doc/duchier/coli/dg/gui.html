<h1>5 Graphical user interface</h1>

The GUI is invoked by starting the executable <code>TDG</code>.
<code>TDG</code> can be parametrized using commandline parameters as
explained in <a href="gui.html#cli">5.4</a> below.

<h2><a name="main">5.1 Main window</a></h2>

<p>
We display the main window of the graphical user interface (GUI)
below:
</p>
<p align=center><img src="main.gif" alt="main window"></p>
<p>
The main window is divided into five parts. The first part is the
topmost row of pulldown-menus, consisting of <em>Project</em>,
<em>Search</em>, <em>Principles</em>, <em>Tools</em>, <em>Display</em>
and <em>Plugins</em>.
</p>

<p>
The second part is a status display showing which grammar file is
currently active (<em>Grammar: grammar-acl.dg</em>), which example file
is currently loaded (<em>Examples: examples-acl.dg</em>) and which
plugins file (<em>Plugins: Plugins-dummy.ozf</em>).
</p>

<p>
The third part is made up of a button labeled <em>Inspect lexical
entries</em> and an adjacent text entry field. Here, a list of words
(including also names of lexical types) can be entered (separated by
spaces) whose corresponding lexical entries shall be depicted using
the Oz Inspector. The function is triggered either by pressing the
<em>Inspect lexical entries</em>-button or by pressing the return key
while the text entry field is active. An example output of this
function for the lexical entries <code>wird</code> and
<code>koennen</code> is given below:
</p>
<p align=center><img src="lex.gif" alt="Inspect lexical entries"></p>

<p>
The fourth part of the main window is a scrollable listview of example
strings. Once clicking on an example string copies it into the text
entry field below, and double clicking indicates that the string shall
be parsed (this is equivalent with pressing the
<em>Parse</em>-button).
</p>

<p>
The fifth part consists of a button labeled <em>Parse</em> and an
adjacent text entry field. In this entry field, the string to parse
can be edited. Parsing is triggered either by pressing the
<em>Parse</em>-button or by pressing the return key whilst the text
entry field is active.
</p>

<h2><a name="menus">5.2 Pulldown menus</a></h2>

<p>
Please bear in mind that each of the pulldown menus can be displayed
in a window on their own by selecting the topmost menu entry
(consisting of dashes). This can prove particularly useful when a
number of switches need to be toggled several times. Also note that
menu entries whose name ends with an ellipsis start functions which
open a dialog window (e.g. a file requestor).  To the right of some
menu entries are keyboard shortcuts such as <em>C-w</em> for the menu
entry <em>Close tree windows</em>.  <em>C-w</em> means that the menu
entry can also be invoked by pressing CTRL and w simultaneously.
</p>

<h3>5.2.1 Project</h3>

<p>
The <em>Project</em>-menu consists of the following menu entries.
<em>About...</em> displays an about window.  <em>Open grammar
file...</em> displays a file requestor by which a new grammar file for
the parser can be selected. This function also tries to find the
corresponding examples- and plugins-files by looking at the grammar
identifier &lt;ID&gt;. For instance when the GUI loads the grammar
file "grammar-&lt;ID&gt;.dg", it also tries to load the the examples
file "examples-&lt;ID&gt;.txt" and the plugins file
"Plugins-&lt;ID&gt;.ozf".  If there is no plugins file available for
the identifier, the dummy plugins file "Plugins-dummy.ozf" is loaded.
Hint: If you have installed the TDG-package with <code>ozmake
--install</code>, then all grammar, examples and Plugin-files have
been put into the directory
"~/.oz/cache/x-ozlib/duchier/coli/dg/". <em>Reload grammar file</em>
reloads the currently active grammar file (useful when the grammar has
changed). <em>Open examples...</em> loads a new examples file.
Examples files are standard text files. <em>Reload examples</em>
reloads the currently loaded text file and <em>Append examples...</em>
appends an examples file to the list of examples currently loaded.
<em>Open plugins...</em> loads a new plugins file. <em>Reload
plugins</em> reloads the selected plugins file. <em>Close tree
windows</em> closes all windows containing TDG analyses which is
particularly useful in case the screen is cluttered up by
them. <em>Quit</em> quits.
</p>

<h3>5.2.2 Search</h3>

<p>
The <em>Search</em>-menu consists of the three parts.  The first
allows the user to choose between the entries <em>First solution</em>
and <em>All solutions</em> <em>First solution</em> means that search
stops after the first solution (parse) has been found, and <em>All
solutions</em> that all solutions are enumerated. The
<em>Distribute</em>-menu entry toggles distribution and the
<em>Generate</em>-entry the generate mode.
</p>

<h3>5.2.3 Principles</h3>

<p>
The <em>Principles</em>-menu contains a number of switches which can
be used to toggle the TDG principles on and off. The first three of
these principles are the set of ID principles. Below are the
LP and TH principles.
</p>

<h3>5.2.4 Tools</h3>

<p>
The <em>Tools</em>-menu consists of three menu entries: <em>Save trees
as LaTeX...</em> allows the user to save all licensed TDG analyses of
the currently selected sentence (in the <em>Parse</em> text entry
field) into a LaTeX-file. The LaTeX-code utilizes Denys Duchier's
"dtree.sty" style file provided with this package. The style file is
explained in <a href="extra.html#sty">Chapter 7.1</a>.  Notice that
the options configured in the <em>Search</em>-menu apply for this
function.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Save test suite...</em>-menu entry starts a function which
goes through all strings in the examples file, parses each string and
writes statistics about the parse into a text file.  The statistics
are of the form
</p>
<pre>
maria wird haben einen mann lieben koennen
 choices:9 failed:1 succeeded:9
</pre>
<p>
where the upper line contains the parsed string and the lower line
information about the search tree: the number of choice points
(<code>choice</code>), of failed spaces (<code>failed</code>) and of
succeeded spaces (<code>succeeded</code>). Note that this function
always searches for all solutions.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Inspect all linearizations</em>-menu entry uses the generate
mode to generate all licensed linearizations of a bag of words.  The
linearizations are displayed in list form. We give
an example output of this function below:
</p>
<p align=center><img src="lins.gif" alt="Inspect all linearizations"></p>
<p>
In addition, each of the displayed linearizations can be parsed by
selecting the corresponding list in the Inspector and invoke the
action <em>Parse</em> from the Inspector's context menu.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Time first solution</em> and <em>Time all solutions</em>-menu
entries can be used to get precise time measures of the parser (more
precise than the measures in the Explorer) for the first and all
solutions, respectively.
</p>

<h3>5.2.5 Display</h3>

<p>
<em>Edge labels on edges</em> and <em>Edge labels on node</em> switch
between whether the edge labels shall be drawn on the edges or on the
nodes (in tree windows).
</p>

<p>
<em>Inspect cardinalities</em> toggles the printing out of set
cardinality information in the Inspector and applies both for the
<em>Pretty</em>-information action and the <em>Inspect lexical
entries</em>-function.
</p>

<p>
The remaining menu entries allow to individually toggle features on
and off when using the <em>Pretty</em>-information action.
</p>

<h3>5.2.6 Plugins</h3>

<p>
Entries in the <em>Plugins</em>-menu are only generated if a non-dummy
plugin is active. They are generated on the basis of the
plugins-specifications explained in <a href="plugins.html">chapter
4</a>.
</p>

<h3>5.2.7 ESSLLI</h3>

<p>
This menu is new in version 1.2. It contains a list of all the grammar
files in the distribution, including the ESSLLI 2002 course grammar
fragments. Click on any of these files to open it.
</p>

<h2><a name="explorer">5.3 Explorer</a></h2>

<p>
We employ the Oz Explorer to display the search space traversed during
distribution. The Explorer is described in
<a href="/documentation/explorer/index.html">
Oz Explorer-Visual Constraint Programming Support</a>. Roughly, blue
circles denote choice points (TDG analyses which are not yet fully
specified) in the search space, green diamonds solutions (fully
specified TDG analyses) and red boxes failures.  If the search space
as displayed by the Explorer contains only red boxes, no parse for the
string could be found. We show an example Explorer search tree below:
</p>
<p align=center><img src="explorer.gif" alt="Explorer search tree"></p>

<p>
Non-failed nodes in the search tree (blue circles and green diamonds)
can be double-clicked to invoke a so-called information action.
Information actions are e.g. the graphical display of the TDG analysis
corresponding to the node in the search tree or a printout of the
internal structure of Signs. The user can choose between several
information actions using the Explorer's pulldown-menu (menu entry
<em>Information Action</em> in the <em>Node</em>-menu), all of which
we explain below.
</p>

<p>
<em>Show</em> prints out the list of Signs on stdio.  <em>Inspect</em>
does the same using the Oz Inspector. The information action
<em>Pretty</em> prints out the list of Signs in prettified, i.e. more
readable form using the Inspector. This action takes into account the
options set in the <em>Display</em> pulldown-menu. The information
actions <em>ID tree</em>, <em>LP tree</em> graphically depict ID and
LP trees in separate windows and <em>ID and LP</em> depicts both trees
in one window. Notice that these windows can be all be closed at once
using the pulldown-menu function <em>Close tree windows</em>. Here is
an example ID/LP tree depiction:
</p>
<p align=center><img src="idlp.gif" alt="ID and LP"></p>

<p>
Tip: Do not close the Explorer window: if you close it, it loses all
information actions except <em>Show</em> and <em>Inspect</em>.
</p>

<h2><a name="cli">5.4 Command-line arguments</a></h2>

<p>
The GUI can be parametrized by command-line arguments. The argument
<code>help</code> prints out a list of all command-line arguments.
</p>

<p>
The argument <code>grammar</code> specifies a grammar to load (the
default is "grammar-de.dg").  The argument <code>examples</code> can
be similarly used to load a specific examples file (default:
"examples-de.txt"), and the argument <code>plugins</code> to load a
plugins file (default: "Plugins-de.ozf").
</p>

<p>
The argument <code>search</code> can be either set to
<code>first</code> (search for the first solution only) or
<code>all</code> (search for all solutions, default). The argument
<code>generate</code> is a boolean argument: it is set to true by
writing <code>--generate</code> and to false by writing
<code>--nogenerate</code>. The default is false. <code>dist</code> is
another boolean and toggles distribution.
</p>

<p>
The following options are all boolean options used to toggle the ID,
LP and TH principles on and off. <code>idacc</code> corresponds to the
ID accepted labels principle, <code>idval</code> to ID valency and
<code>idgamma</code> to ID edge constraints.  <code>lporder</code>
corresponds to the LP order principle, <code>lpproj</code> to LP
projectivity, <code>lpacc</code> to the LP accepted labels principle,
<code>lpval</code> to LP valency, <code>lpnode</code> to LP accepted
node labels and <code>lpgamma</code> to LP edge constraints.
<code>climbing</code> corresponds to the LP climbing principle,
<code>subtrees</code> to LP subtrees and <code>barriers</code> to LP
barriers. <code>thacc</code> is the TH accepted labels principle,
<code>thval</code> the TH valency principle, <code>thgamma</code> the
TH edge constraints and <code>link</code> the TH linking principle.
The default for all of those switches is <code>true</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>edgelabels</code>-argument can be either set to
<code>edge</code> or <code>node</code> and determines the edge label
placement. <code>cards</code> is a boolean argument and toggles the
printing out of set cardinality information.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example where the GUI is given the identifier "acl" to load
the grammar file "grammar-acl.dg", the examples file
"examples-acl.txt" and the dummy plugins file "Plugins-dummy.ozf"
(because there is no plugins file for the identifier "acl") searches
only for the first solution and switches the LP order principle off:
</p>
<pre>
TDG --grammar=grammar-de.dg --search=first --nolporder
</pre>
