The Mogul system allows user or group of users to create their own Mozart package and make them publicly available to all the developper community. The creation process of a package involves writing the documentation, creating an archive of all required files and declaring those to the Mogul librarian. For this you need to create text files containing informations about your package and place these files in a public URL where the Mogul Librairian can regularly check them and update its own database.</P><P>The Mogul Helper application helps you manage the data you have to specify to the Mogul Librarian and create the appropriate text files.</P><H2><A name="label1">1.1 First contacts with Mogul and the Mogul Helper application</A></H2><P>All the packages you declare to the Mogul Librarian are regrouped under an identifier that is personnal to you. The Mogul Librarian reads your Mogul entries from text files that are placed at a specific URL. For example someone named Sherlock Holmes might ask for the mogul identifier <EM>holmes</EM>. This id will be reserved to him and only him. When using Mogul Helper, Sherlock will save its Mogul entries into the filename <EM>~/public-html/mogul/holmesentry</EM> which can be reached by the URL <EM>http://www.detectives.org/~holmes/mogul/holmesentry</EM>. To declare this information to the Mogul Librarian, Sherlock Holmes have to send an email to contrib@mozart-oz.org with the following information : </P><UL><LI><P>An email address for administrative purposes. It will be used to report problems concerning this section of the MOGUL database. If missing, the sender email address will be used.</P></LI><LI><P>A url for the database entry describing the section of the MOGUL database. The MOGUL Librarian will update your section of the database by fetching the entry at this url and recursively processing subentries.</P></LI><LI><P>Optionally, an alternative list of mogul ids and, if possible, we will pick one from this list, if they are still available and not objectionable.</P></LI></UL><P> We will reply to the ``administrative'' email address, telling which id have been granted. </P><H2><A name="label2">1.2 First time Mogul Helper is started</A></H2><P>When starting Mogul Helper, a dialog box appears : select <EM>Create a new Mogul database</EM> and click <EM>Ok</EM>. A dialog box appears : type your mogul id as was granted to you and click <EM>Ok</EM>. A dialog box appears requesting informations about the contributor. You have to pick an id for the author, then specify your name and email adress. Note that if the Mogul Librarian messes your name up in the index of the Mogul web pages, you can fix it by clicking <EM>Override name for index</EM> and specify the exact name you want to appear in the Mogul web pages. Clicking on <EM>Ok</EM> confirms the information you entered and starts the application.</P><P>The packages can be organised in sections, very much like files can be organised in directories. A section can contain subsections and packages. The root section is defined by the personal identificator you were granted.</P><H2><A name="label3">1.3 Using Mogul Helper</A></H2><P>The main window of Mogul Helper is composed of two parts : </P><UL><LI><P>Top area : graphical tree view of all packages and sections.</P></LI><LI><P>Down area : contextual view depending of what is selected in the top area : </P><UL><LI><P>Section : a four button menu allowing to add a package or a subsection, rename this section, or delete it (unavailable for the root section).</P></LI><LI><P>Package : the package definition is shown. The package definition can be edited by clicking the <EM>Edit...</EM> button. The package can also be removed from its section by clicking the <EM>Delete...</EM> button. If you check the check button <EM>Mogul form</EM>, the package definition is shown as described in the Mogul database.</P></LI></UL><P></P></LI></UL><P> The user interface is quite straigthforward : click on the item in the top area that you want to view/edit and select the appropriate action in the down area. This will usually bring a dialog box requesting to fill informations. When you have finished updating your mogul entries, select <EM>Save...</EM> from the <EM>File</EM> menu. As the Mogul Librarian scans only the file at the URL you specified when asking your Mogul id, save to this location or copy to this location. </P><P>Note that the mogul database is composed of several files : one for each section, one for each package and one for the author definition. For example if you save your Mogul database to <EM>~holmes/public-html/mogul/entry</EM>, the Mogul Helper application will generate an <EM>entry</EM> file, but also several other files. All these files must be reachable by the Mogul Librarian, so make sure that they are all on a web server in the same directory as <EM>entry</EM> and have all the correct rights set. </P></DIV><TABLE align="center" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="6" class="nav"><TR bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><TD><A href="index.html">- Up -</A></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><ADDRESS>Donatien Grolaux<BR><SPAN class="version">Version 1.1.1 (20000613)</SPAN></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>
