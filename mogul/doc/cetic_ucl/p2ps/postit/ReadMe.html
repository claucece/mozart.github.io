<h1><u>PostIt Application (vs 2.0)</u></h1>
 </div>
 
<div align="Left"> 
<h2>Description</h2>
 </div>
 
<div align="Left">PostIt is an example of the appliance of the peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to area of collaborative work. It is a graphical application where users share a board for publishing postits (short time lived texts). It is written in <a href="http://www.mozart-oz.org">Mozart</a>.
<br>
<br>
PostIt uses the <b>P2PS</b> library (available <a href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/mogul/info/cetic_ucl/p2ps.html">here</a>).
<b>P2PS</b> is a P2P library implementing a distributed hash table, called <i>Tango</i></a>.
<br>
<br>
 
<h2>Program retrieving and compilation</h2>
<!-- Either you download <a href="PostIt_2.0.tar.gz">the PostIt_2.0.tar.gz sources</a> and compile them, or if you are running Mozart version 1.2.5, the simplest way consists in downloading a binary package <a href="PostIt.exe"><b>PostIt.exe</b></a>. <br> -->
<i>The PostIt code is no more compatible with the new P2PS library. If you really want it, we can provide it for you; just let us know.</i> 
<br>
The PostIt application requires the QTk.ozf functor for graphical display. Usually Mozart distributions include the QTk module. However you can have QTk module either by installing the <a href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/view.cgi">standard Mozart library</a>, or by taking it from <a href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/mogul/">Mogul</a>.
 <br>
 
<h2>PostIt invocation and use</h2>
You can invoke the precompiled PostIt by typing: "ozengine PostIt.exe". This will call the right <i>oz engine</i> on different OSs.
<br>
If you choosed to compile the application yourself, you can invoke it by simply typing: "PostIt".
<br>
Then, if everything goes right, the Profile Edition window will be displayed inviting you to enter a user name.
Note that you can choose the desired character font size by invoking the application with the parameter --fs=<i>font_size</i>.

 <br>
 <br>
         The user name will be used by the system to fill in the sender field
 of  all   messages that you will send during the PostIt session. Note, you
can change your user name during one session. Once you entered your user
name, click  on the OK button to register. <br>
 <br>
         The next appearing window is the main PostIt window.<br>
 <img src="MailDisplay.jpg" alt="Main Postit window" width="528" height="510" hspace="20" vspace="20">
 <br>
 <br>
This main window is composed of three sections : menu, message display, 
and  node status. 
 <br>
The File menu will allow you to create new messages and
to exit the application while the edit menu will allow you to edit the
user  profile.  
 <br>
The second section (message display) is composed by 3 sub-sections: Mail  Folders List (default Inbox), Message Header List and Message.
The mail folders list shows you the available mail folders and the amount
of unread messages in each folders. Currently only one folder exists (Inbox)
and you are not allowed to create a new one. 
 <br>
The second sub-section displays
the list of messages  header contained in the selected folders (<b>bold
font</b> = unread message).  
The third sub-section displays the message
selected  in the Message Header  List. 
Finally, the third section displays
the node status: <i>Connected</i> is <b>true</b> if the node is member of the PostIt network; <i>Externally reachable</i> is <b>true</b> if the node is member of the PostIt network as a peer node (not as a client to a proxy); and <i>Proxy clients</i> is the number of nodes (usually behind fire-walls) using your PostIt application as a Proxy to connected to the PostIt network.  
<br>
Note that even if you are not connected to the PostIt network you can compose messages by selecting new messages in the file menu or by clicking
with the right mouse button on the message display area.  
<br>

 <br>
The compose message window allows the user to specify the subject
 and the  body of the message. Moreover, the user can choose the duration
 of the message on the PostIt board (by default 15 minutes). The duration of a message is the  amount of time  the message will stay inside the system. Once this period is passed, the  message will automatically disappear from the
system.  Once you finish editing the message, click on send to transmit it to
all the  PostIt community or click on cancel if you changed your mind.<br>
 <br>
The latest graphical component is the Connection one that you can
 display    by selecting it in the main window panel.
<br>

 <br>
There you can see the Peers cache. The peers cache display the address 
of well known peer node. This cache is used if the auto connection is 
activated (actually this feature is not yet implemented). If the auto connection is  not activated or failed, you can connect your application to the PostIt
network   by entering the address and the port number of a known peer in
the bottom-right   entry widget (PeerAddress@PortNumber). Click on Connect
to perform the connection.   During the connection establishment, the Connecting Status is <i>In Progress...</i>,   once the connection is established, the Connecting Status is <i>Connection Succeeded</i> while if the connection could not be established,
the Connecting Status is <i>Connection Failed</i>.  <br>
