Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are becoming more and more popular. Beside the advantages they bring, their intrinsic attributes such as dynamic topology change, equal capability among nodes, and node heterogeneity raise different challenges that have to be met. Our research is focused on addressing, what we belive to be, the three most important challenges. First, there is the efficient and scalable data location within a P2P system. Second, there is the P2P system adaptivity as response to different actions such as network faults and partitions. Finally, we work on the developing of communication primitives for P2P networks.

test different P2P systems: <b>Tango</b> [<a href="papers.html">2</a>], S-Chord [<a href="papers.html">4</a>, <a href="papers.html">5</a>], and DKS [<a href="http://www.sics.se/~sameh/pub.php" target="_parent">X</a>],

have a P2P system on which we can add and test new functionalities,

have a "touchable" outcome of our work so we can show demos to others
