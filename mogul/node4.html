It looks exactly like an email message: it begins with a sequence of headers. It may also have a body separated from the headers by 1 or more empty lines.</P><P>There can be no empty line in the header part! The first empty line is interpreted as the separation between headers and body. However, one header may extend over several lines provided none is empty and all but the 1st one begin with a space or tab character. This is the usual convention for email headers too!</P><P>You can include arbitrary headers in an entry. However, only certain headers are meaningful to the <SPAN class="name">MOGUL Librarian</SPAN>. Below we take a look at each of the 3 types of database entries and describe for each one the meaningful headers and their interpretation.</P><P class="margin">Header <CODE>type</CODE></P><P> Only one header is mandatory for all database entries, namely the <CODE>type</CODE> header. It is required in order to identify the type of the entry.</P><P class="margin">Header <CODE>id</CODE></P><P> It is not necessary to provide an <CODE>id</CODE> header since an entry can only be reached via a ``section'' entry, which already gives both its id and its url. However doing so is good practice. It is also safer: the <SPAN class="name">MOGUL Librarian</SPAN> performs a sanity check; if a header id is provided, it must contain the expected id otherwise an error is reported (and eventually will find its way back to you via automated email).</P><HR><UL class="toc"><LI><A href="node5.html#sec.format.contact">2.2.1 Contact Entry</A></LI></UL><UL class="toc"><LI><A href="node6.html#sec.format.section">2.2.2 Section Entry</A></LI></UL><UL class="toc"><LI><A href="node7.html#sec.format.package">2.2.3 Package Entry</A></LI></UL></DIV><TABLE align="center" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="6" class="nav"><TR bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><TD><A href="node3.html#sec.types">&lt;&lt; Prev</A></TD><TD><A href="node2.html">- Up -</A></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><ADDRESS><A href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/">Denys&nbsp;Duchier</A><BR><SPAN class="version">Version 1.3.0 (20040413)</SPAN></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>
